# Welcome to Modular Thoughts! üëã

I'm a 28-year-old **senior front-end developer** living in London. I‚Äôve spent the past 6+ years building software across different industries. I like to think of myself as **‚Äúfront-end first, full-stack capable‚Äù** ‚Äî someone who loves crafting user interfaces & apps, and comfortable working across the stack when needed.

```js
Modular Thoughts is my career journal, where I talk about tech, software, philosophy and more!

**Technologies I work with**

I've built many applications with **TypeScript, JavaScript, SCSS, React, Vue and React Native**. On the back-end, I've contributed to projects with Node.js, NestJS, and .NET/C#. **I'm not limited to any of these though**, always looking to learn and adapt. Knowledge is transferable (specially in these [wild days of AI](https://www.xaviermod.com/post/a-positive-outlook-of-the-future-of-software-engineering)). 

**Follow my journey**

I feel incredibly fortunate to be part of an industry I genuinely love. My passion for computers, software, and games has been a constant throughout my life, and turning that lifelong interest into a career is something I never take for granted.
