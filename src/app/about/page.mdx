## What do I do?

I'm working as a **front-end developer** at [DrDoctor](https://www.drdoctor.co.uk/), making lots of cool software used by hundreds of NHS trusts and millions of patients across the UK. I graduated in 2021 from a Bachelor's degree in [Digital Design](https://www.brunel.ac.uk/study/courses/digital-design-bsc).

Prior to that and over the past five years, I've worked in other startups and agencies, from creating influencer-marketing platforms to working with big clients such as American Express and Deloitte.

I love to build software outside of my full-time roles too, recently having co-founded [Flatini](https://www.drdoctor.co.uk/), a chrome extension to find flats to rent in London, or [Interplanetary](https://www.drdoctor.co.uk/), an pixel-art RPG game I'm developing using Godot and GDScript.

## Why do I do it?

I love technology and software, and consider myself very fortunate to do something so fun for a living. I've been very passionate about computers, software and games my entire life.
