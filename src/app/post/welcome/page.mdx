# Modular Thoughts is born

I'm Xavier, software developer based in London. You can read more about me [here](/about). 

This space was born from **two key needs**. First, it's the natural evolution of my past portfolio websites. As I step into more senior roles in tech, my interests have expanded beyond just showcasing projects: I want to explore and discuss the topics I find fascinating.

I've organized my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/XavierMod) to highlight the projects I’ve built, and this blog will serve as a place to dive deeper into the ideas that inspire me. Expect thoughts on:

  - **Technology** and its growing influence on society.
  - **Software** development, with a strong focus on front-end technologies (but not limited to them).
  - **Philosophy**, particularly *minimalism* and *stoicism*, and how it shapes my thinking, my work, my life and my relationships.

We live in truly fascinating times. AI is reshaping how we interact with technology and software, while the world around us faces more challenges than ever. Global political tensions don't let us catch a break, and yet, for developers, this is an incredible time to be building stuff. We have the power to design and shape this unprecedented digital landscape—one that is becoming increasingly intertwined with our daily lives.

There’s so much more to discuss here, but one thing I firmly believe: **developers should embrace change, adaptability and curiosity beyond specializations**. The world needs both maintainers and creators—there’s an endless amount of software to build, improve, and sustain. And now, we’re doing it in a hyper-connected world, powered by the most advanced technology we’ve ever seen.

I’m excited to share my journey, insights, and discoveries with you!
