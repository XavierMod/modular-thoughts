# Building software like beavers build dams: My approach to Software Development

[Beavers are remarkable engineers](https://ecologi.com/articles/blog/why-are-beavers-ecosystem-engineers) — not because they build the most intricate structures, but because they build only what's necessary. With just mud, sticks, and instinct, they construct dams that can reshape rivers, create ecosystems, and protect their homes from predators. Every branch has a purpose. No excess. No decoration. Just what’s most valuable and needed.

At university, we used to compete with each other to see who could come up with the best-looking interface. I would spend hours on Pinterest and Dribbble, constantly searching for inspiration and coming up with ideas to design the most visually appealing UI possible. I believed that what would set me apart as a designer and developer was how polished and beautiful my work looked.

But that belief changed completely as soon as I left uni.

The world is saturated with complexities and problems. As software developers, we create platforms that help people navigate this complexity and stay connected, no matter where they are in the world. Over time, I've come to realise that the true goal of any interface we develop isn't for someone to say, “Wow, that looks beautiful.” Instead, the real success comes when someone says:

**“I can now do perform my day to day tasks faster,” or “This software allows me to do something I couldn't do before.”**

That's not to say software can't or shouldn't be visually stunning. Aesthetics are often an integral part of resonating with users. But visuals are not the goal — solving real problems is. And there's no better way to fix problems than through simplicity.

# Keep it Simple, Stupid.

One of my core philosophies when architecting software, implementing new features, or working on side projects is the [KISS](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/keep-it-simple-stupid) principle: **“Keep it simple, stupid.”** We must conceptualise, design, and implement software that is as simple as possible. In essence, this means applying the philosophy of [minimalism](https://minimalism.com/journal/an-ancient-philosophy) in our work.

Simplicity guarantees the highest levels of user acceptance and interaction. I always remind myself: users have very busy lives, and they use software as a means to an end. The more complex the experience, the worse it becomes. I've felt genuine frustration when a website doesn't work the way I expect it to — a fascinating phenomenon where a human interacting with a machine can trigger a strong emotional response.

When working at [DrDoctor](https://www.drdoctor.co.uk/), I was exposed to many layers of complexity. Collaborating directly with the NHS opened up a world of opportunities — and challenges. There were complex interactions happening at multiple levels: human-to-human, human-to-machine, and everything in between.

We realised that the solution to most of these challenges was always the same: craft the simplest possible solution, get it in front of users quickly, and maintain high quality. The focus had to be on core functionality — not on imagined features or speculative needs.

[Power users](https://userpilot.com/blog/power-users/) and complex workflows should evolve naturally from real usage, not from upfront assumptions. They should be a response to feedback, not a starting point in design.

# Falling for the Power User trap

Several teams I've worked with have fallen into the same trap: designing early on for the most technical, demanding, and vocal users. It often feels like the right decision, especially because power users give the most feedback. But they do not represent the majority.

That said, power users are still important to consider. They can help expose edge cases, validate more specific needs, and push the boundaries of the software we're building. But if you build for them too early, you end up adding unnecessary features, complicating the user experience, and making your platform harder to build and maintain.

// Beehive hexagons are nature’s most efficient use of space and materials — scalable, modular, resilient, and elegantly designed. Sounds familiar?
```

Over the years, I've come to a strong conclusion: even the most complicated business logic can lead to a simple user experience. In fact, it should.

The main goal of any software product should be to deliver its most minimal and valuable version. Overthinking is an easy trap to fall into, but good decision-making is rooted in simplicity and clarity. The benefits are enormous: simpler products are easier to understand, faster to build, easier to maintain, and quicker to validate.

# The solution is well... simple. Less software means more software:

Focusing on what's most valuable — the essence of minimalism — can be applied at every stage of the development process:

    **Ideation**: I aim to focus on identifying core user problems, not feature wishlists.

    **Design**: I aim to emphasise clear hierarchy, consistency, and visual simplicity.

    **Technical Planning**: I aim to choose the simplest tools and architectural structures that will get the job done well.

    **Coding**: I aim for simple, readable code — clear naming, no over-abstraction, and functions kept small and purposeful.

    **Testing**: I aim to focus on unit tests and the “Arrange, Act, Assert” pattern to validate core functionality efficiently.

    **Deployment**: I aim to prefer small, feature-branch-based deployments that ship minimal changes quickly to gather feedback.

    **Code Reviews**: I aim to not let personal preference become a blocker. Style disagreements are taken outside of the PR cycle to keep things moving.

    **Monitoring**: I aim to track only the most critical user paths and key performance metrics — not everything that can be measured.

    **Iteration**: Feedback drives the roadmap. I never base decisions on assumptions. Simplicity and real-world feedback guide growth more reliably than any speculation.

Simplicity isn’t about doing less work. It’s about doing the right work — and doing it in a way that makes sense for both users and developers. When we focus on solving the real problem with the most minimal, valuable solution possible, we unlock the best version of what software can be.
