# A minimal workspace: why less is more

![My setup](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Ep-O0PiTlRIF8tbNkdNra-IxZJPRqpVe)

I first discovered [Minimalism](https://mnmlist.com/) when I was 18 years old, and since then, it’s become one of my core philosophies. Over the years, the way **minimalism influences my life** has evolved, but its essence remains the same: _less is more_. It’s not about simplifying life to the point of owning as few things as possible or having fewer than 100 possessions. Instead, **minimalism is a practical philosophy** that has helped me focus on what truly matters, clearing out distractions and creating space for the things and people that add value to my life. It’s a mindset that provides **freedom**, and it’s had a profound influence on my career, especially my work environment.

**Software development is a huge part of my life**, and my workspace plays an important role in how I do my best work. Working from home has given me the freedom to design my environment in a way that allows me to focus completely on what I’m doing. Minimalism has been a key factor in shaping how I approach my workspace, and today, I want to share how it’s influenced my setup.

I consider myself very fortunate to have lived in both Barcelona and London, and have an economical position that's allowed me to experiment with different setups. From large desks with multiple monitors to minimalist setups with just a laptop, I’ve tried it all. After nearly half a decade of experimentation, I’ve finally found my ultimate workspace: **one that isn't**.

Let me explain: I’ve gone from having a large desk with multiple monitors and a desktop PC to a minimalist setup featuring a foldable table, a practical foldable chair, and a portable monitor. Despite owning fewer items, I’ve found that** I’ve achieved more**:

**Space becomes bigger and multi-use once the foldable desk is put away.**

A foldable table and chair allow me to pack away my workspace at the end of the day. I live in a small room in North London, and I didn’t realize how much space I was wasting when I had a large desk and bulky chairs occupying the room all the time. Now, with the table and chair stored away, the room feels bigger, and my workspace becomes more versatile. For example, I can move the foldable table next to my bed to use as a bedside table. On days when I want a more relaxed environment, I can even work from my bed.

**More connection to the space itself: fewer distractions, more connection.**

By reducing the number of monitors, cables, and accessories, my workspace feels more connected to the rest of the room. It’s easier to enjoy my surroundings, look out the window, and feel the flow of air. I can easily move the table if the sun is in my eyes or shift the setup to the living room for a change of scenery. This simplicity helps me feel more grounded and less distracted by clutter.

**Easier to clean and organize.**

With fewer things to maintain, there’s less to clean and organize. My workspace consists of just two cables—one to charge my laptop and another to connect my portable monitor. Sometimes, if I’m just working with the laptop, even those are unnecessary. The result? Less time spent tidying up and more time focusing on what matters.

**It’s made me realize how productive a single screen can be.**

In my quest for a minimalist setup, I began exploring how to be more productive with fewer devices. I was surprised to find that a single laptop screen could be incredibly efficient. I make use of virtual desktops to separate different tasks, keep my desktop free of clutter, and focus on just a few browser tabs at a time. Using an ergonomic mouse with additional buttons also boosts my productivity. I’ll write more about my laptop setup and how Windows 11 has helped increase my productivity in another post.

**A portable monitor: smaller, lighter, and still effective.**

While I still believe multiple monitors can enhance productivity in some cases, traditional monitors take up space, gather dust, and require multiple cables. I’ve replaced my large monitors with a lightweight portable one. It’s compact, easy to carry, and can connect directly to my laptop without needing its own power source. While it may not offer the same color accuracy or resolution as the ones I used before, it’s perfec for my needs. This is all about necessity over quantity.

**A foldable chair: comfort with flexibility.**

I’ve traded optimising comfort for practicality with my foldable chair. This chair is made of rattan and wood, and while it’s not the most cushioned or luxurious, it’s incredibly functional. It helps me maintain good posture and provides the support I need for several hours of work. When I want comfort, I head to the sofa or bed. The chair’s portability also means I can use it in different areas of my home, depending on where I’m working. ’m curious to see how it holds up in the long run.

**Portable workspace means consistency everywhere.**

I often travel between Barcelona and London, and my portable setup makes it easy to work from anywhere. My essential tools—a laptop, an ergonomic mouse, a portable monitor, and a Steam Deck—fit perfectly in my backpack, so I’m never tied to a single location. I can work from a coffee shop or a park and maintain the same level of productivity I have at home. A lot of people I know say, “I can’t work from a coffee shop today because I need my monitor.” It’s freeing not to have that limitation.

I love my workspace because it isn’t fixed. It’s flexible, adaptable, and can be whatever I need it to be. It’s the cleanest it’s ever been, and it’s made me appreciate my devices in ways I never did before. It's freeing.
