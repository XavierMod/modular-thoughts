Software apps and tools have become indispensable in most modern workplaces across various sectors. **Software is a crucial part of our daily routines**: word processors, email platforms, social media, CRMs, spreadsheets, and more. The software industry itself is no exception. We not only create software for others to use, but **we also consume it** daily. Tools like _Slack, Jira, Notion, Gmail, Azure, Miro, Zoom, and Teams_ have become integral in facilitating communication and collaboration in the workplace.

These tools are most effective when they focus on two key aspects: **fostering collaboration** and **connecting with human values and emotions**.

## Why real-time collaboration is important

Collaboration is essential in today’s fast-paced and complex world. As employees seek greater flexibility and harmony between work and personal lives, collaborative tools enable real-time interactions that reduce errors, boost creativity, align workflows, and ultimately help teams complete projects faster. Humans **thrive** in collaborative environments.

A great example of this is [Miro](https://miro.com/app/dashboard/), a platform that helps teams move from idea to execution in a variety of ways. It mimics **real-life collaboration**, where people can create and track ideas just as they would with post-it notes on a physical board. You can follow each other's cursors, vote on topics, and contribute simultaneously, all in real time. This type of seamless interaction helps teams feel connected, much like they would in an in-person setting.

## Why software tools have to connect with developers, not just make their work easier

But collaboration isn’t enough on its own. The tools we use also need to **connect with humans on a deeper lever** than just showing a dashboard with some data. They have to be easy to use and straight to the point, but as social and emotional beings, we need platforms that are enjoyable to use and allow us to express ourselves. In collaborative settings, it’s vital that the tools not only enhance productivity but also promote engagement and human connection.

```

At [DrDoctor](https://www.drdoctor.co.uk/), we've started using [Gather](https://www.gather.town/), a meeting platform that takes virtual interactions to the next level by making them more human and enjoyable. Similar to Zoom or Teams, Gather facilitates remote meetings but adds a layer of gamification to enhance the experience. We’ve created a virtual office space where everyone has their own character and desk, which can be fully customized. When we need to meet or pair up to collaborate, we simply walk to a meeting room in our virtual space. The platform then transforms into a traditional meeting interface, making it feel like we’re truly interacting in person.

Initially, I was skeptical about Gather, as it looked too much like a game. Why would anyone want to feel like they're playing a game during work? However, I soon realized Gather wasn't about turning meetings into games. Instead, it’s about **recreating the small, human moments of office life**, while still working remotely. Rather than clicking a cold, impersonal meeting link, we walk up to someone’s desk, wave to them (in a virtual sense), and engage in conversation — much like we would in the physical world. This small touch fosters a sense of community while still enabling the flexibility and unbeatable advantages of remote working.

Tools like Gather also encourage a culture of pairing and mob programming. When you see people engaged in an open discussion or working together on a task, it invites others to join in. This creates a dynamic and collaborative environment that wouldn't be possible in a traditional meeting setup.
